Did my "programming" for a buck 80-90's at machine code level or assembler on very old micros. Also did some work on  HP Automatic test equipment writing
testing programs for radios and stuff in the 00's. Then got promoted and did not touch stuff except if things hit the fan. Retired because of covid so doing stuff as a
hobby now. My my Microcontrollers have advanced!
